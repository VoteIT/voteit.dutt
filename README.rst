This is a poll plugin for VoteIT. It gives you the ability to create checkboxes
for proposals that are part of a poll. It can also be used as a poll for time budgets or
similar.

Note: This is not a suitable method for elections with several winners, unless the
proposals get at least 50% of the available votes. Normally, Schulze polls is always
a better option.
