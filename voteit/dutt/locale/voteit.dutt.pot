#. Default: Tick proposals you like. There's a max amount, but you can add less
#. if you want. This method is ment for time budgets or for preliminary checks.
#. It should never be used to approve or deny proposals.

#. Default: Preliminary checks or time budgets, never for actual decisions.

#. Default: You're using a very unsafe poll method that can easily be
#. manipulated. Even without tactical voting, it's very likely to give the
#. wrong result. If your goal is to have a usable poll result,use Sorted
#. Schulze or Scottish STV. If you're simply distributing points for something
#. that isn't actually approved or denied (like a time budget) it's perfectly
#. fine to use this.
